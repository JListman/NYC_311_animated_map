# Animated Choropleth Map of NYC 311 Rat Complaint Data
In R, make an animated map or gif of NYC 311 data by zip code and month as well as a line graph showing seasonal changes by NYC Borough. This example uses reports of rat sightings to NYC's 311. 

Read a blog post with a summary of the results [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/new-yorkers-should-learn-to-get-along-with-rats-because-theyre-not-leaving-a-data-visualization-db4ca516762b). Find out more about my work on my [website](https://jenny-listman.netlify.com).
